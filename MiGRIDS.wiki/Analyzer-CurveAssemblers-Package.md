This sub-package contains methods to estimate sufficiently dense performance data curves from input information such that general model data resolution can be assured. 

The following curve assemblers are implemented:

* [esLossMapAssembler](Analyzer-CurveAssemblers-esLossMapAssembler)
* [generateTimeSeriesFromTransitionMatrix](Analyzer-CurveAssemblers-generateTimeSeriesFromTransitionMatrix)
* [genFuelCurveAssembler](Analyzer-CurveAssemblers-genFuelCurveAssemblers)
* [wtgCurveAssembler](wtgCurveAssembler)
