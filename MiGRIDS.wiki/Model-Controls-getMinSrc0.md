[getMinSrc0](/acep-uaf/MiGRIDS/blob/master/MiGRIDS/Model/Controls/getMinSrc0.py) takes `minSRCToSwitchRatio` as its input. This is the ratio of the SRC required to switch which diesel generators are online and the SRC required to keep the current generators online. Having a value greater than 1 can be used to reduce the switching of diesel generators. `getMinSrc0` takes the average of the past 10 minute load in its calculation.
