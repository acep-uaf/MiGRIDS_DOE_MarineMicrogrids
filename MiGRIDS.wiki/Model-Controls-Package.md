# Introduction
The Model.Controls package contains control modules that are used to dispatch (send power setpoints), schedule (bring components on and offline) and predict future variable generation and load. A number of individual control modules are included with this software package. Additional one can be created by the user and linked to in the [projectSetup.xml](projectSetup-XML) and [projectSetAttributes.xml](projectSetAttributes-XML) files. The Model.Controls package contains the following groups of modules: 
* [eesDispatch](Model-Controls-eesDispatch)
* [genDispatch](Model-Controls-genDispatch)
* [getMinSrc](Model-Controls-getMinSrc)
* [predictLoad](Model-Controls-predictLoad)
* [predictWind](Model-Controls-predictWind)
* [reDispatch](Model-Controls-reDispatch)
* [tesDispatch](Model-Controls-tesDispatch)
* [wtgDispatch](Model-Controls-wtgDispatch)
