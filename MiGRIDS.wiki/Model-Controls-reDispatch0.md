[reDispatch0](/acep-uaf/MiGRIDS/blob/master/MiGRIDS/Model/Controls/reDispatch0.py) implements a maximum rate of change in the power output of the wind turbines and uses the TESS to balance out fluctuations in the deviations between the power set point and actual output of the wind turbines. Inputs for wind farm response rate and target loading of the thermal energy storage system are given in [projectReDispatch0Inputs](/acep-uaf/MiGRIDS/blob/master/MiGRIDS/Model/Resources/Setup/projectReDispatch0Inputs.xml).
