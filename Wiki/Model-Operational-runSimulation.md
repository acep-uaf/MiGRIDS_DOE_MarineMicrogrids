The `runSimulation` function goes through each run in a simulation and runs them in order. Which simulation has been run is stored in an SQL dataframe, so multiple `runSimulation` instances can be run in parallel on the same set of simulation runs. It reads the input data from the [setup](Model-Resources-Setup) and [component](Model-Resource-Components-Package) XML files and runs [SystemOperations](Model-Operational-SystemOperations) with the input data. After a simulation run, output netCDF files are saved in the `projectName/OutputData/Setx/Runy/OutputData` directory, where `x` and `y` are the identifiers for the set and run.
