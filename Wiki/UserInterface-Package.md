The UserInterface Package provides tools for creating model input files, running models and evaluating output. It consists of a main form with navigation tree and pages dedicated to each of the primary steps for running models. The 4 primary interface tabs are: Setup and Model Runs.

The Setup tab offers tools to import raw data files and prepare netcdf files for model input as well as necessary xml files. 

The Model tab provides tools for adjusting model inputs, initiated simulations and view model results.
