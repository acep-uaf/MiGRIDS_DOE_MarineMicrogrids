Description

OBJECTIVE: The functionality of this class is to:
    a) determine if the data provide in wtgDescriptor.xml already is sufficiently dense to define the power curve without
    estimation of additional points.
    b) if necessary estimate additional points of the power curve such that a dense curve available.

A dense curve will have power levels associated with all wind speeds in increments of 0.1 m/s and approximates power in
1 kW steps. Several methods are useful in estimating power curves for wind turbines. For now, this module only implements
calculation of via cubic splines. For a source discussing splines and other methods of estimation see Sohoni, Gupta and Nema, 2016:
    https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jen/2016/8519785/

ASSUMPTIONS:
    INPUTS: data used as input is already from a cleaned up power curve. This tool is not intended to produce a power
    from operational time-series data, which would require cleaning and filtering. Thus, it is required that for each
    wind speed value one and only one power value exists. That is, temperature compensations, if desired will have to be
    handled separately.

    CUTOUTWINDSPEEDMAX describes the point beyond which the turbine is shut off for protection. Right at this point, it
    produces power at nameplate capacity levels. Beyond this point the turbine is stopped and P = 0 kW.

    CUTOUTWINDSPEEDMIN describes the point where the turbine does not produce power any longer, e.g. P = 0 kW at this
    wind speed.

    CUTINWINDSPEED is the minimum wind speed at which a stopped turbine starts up. At this point power production is
    immediately greater zero, i.e. CUTOUTWINDSPEEDMIN < CUTINWINDSPEED.

OUTPUTS:
    The output is a WindPowerCurve object, which contains the new estimated power curve, as well as additional methods
    to estimate air density corrections (later).

# General Imports
import numpy as np
from scipy.interpolate import CubicSpline

'''
The WindPowerCurve class contains methods to determine a wind power curve from data provided in the wtgDescriptor.xml 
file. 
INPUTS: 
    powerCurveDataPoints: list of tuples of floats, e.g., [(ws0, p0), ... , (wsN, pN)], where ws and p are wind speed (m/s) and 
    power (kW) respectively.
    cutInWindSpeed: float, wind speed at which a stopped turbine begins to produce power again, m/s
    cutOutWindSpeedMin: float, the wind speed at which the turbine does not produce power anymore due to lack of wind
    power, units are m/s
    cutOutWindSpeedMax: float, the wind speed beyond which the turbine is stopped for protection, units are m/s.
    POutMaxPa: float, nameplate power of the turbine, units are kW.

OUTPUTS:
    powerCurve: list of tuples of floats, with a defined range ws = 0 m/s to ws = cutOutWindSpeedMax and some fixed 
    points 
    powerCurve = [(0,0), (cutOutWindSpeedMin, 0), ..., (cutOutWindSpeedMax, PCutOutWindSpeedMax), (>cutOutWindSpeedMax, 0)]
    Wind speeds are reported in increments of 0.1 m/s, power values are in kW.
    powerCurveInt: list of tuples of integers derived from the float values in `powerCurve` by rounding to the nearest 
    integer and typecasting from float to int. Wind speed data, to preserve resolution, is multiplied by 10, e.g., 
    3.6 m/s is now reported as 36, and power data is rounded to the next kW. 
     

METHODS:
    checkInputs: Internal method. Checks input data for basic consistency and ensures that there are no duplicate data points which could 
    interfere with some of the curve approximations that assume there is a unique power value for each wind speed. 
    cubicSplineCurveEstimator: calculates a cubic spline for the give input data set with the constraints given by the 
    power curve, cut-in and cut-out wind speeds, a condition that the boundary conditions be `clamped`, i.e., that the 
    first derivative at the end points be zero, and with the condition that the spline not extrapolate to points outside 
    the input interval.
